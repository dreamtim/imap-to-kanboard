[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/watchdogpolska/imap-to-webhook/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/watchdogpolska/imap-to-webhook)

A stateless service is designed to build a relay between an IMAP server and any web application in a simple,
convenient way, well-known by web-developers, without delving into the format of the mail format.

Using the service requires only writing one HTTP endpoint!

It periodically retrieves IMAP messages from selected IMAP folder, parsers them into a convenient JSON object for
use in web applications. Next to send to specified HTTP(S) endpoint. The message can be moved to
another IMAP folder or deleted completely. In case of connection errors, the message is moved to another folder.

Send JSON object, among others includes:

 * extracted HTML (if available) or text content
 * message divided into content and quote
 * all attachments and filenames of them,
 * indication if the message is automatic (vacation reply, confirmation of receipt)
